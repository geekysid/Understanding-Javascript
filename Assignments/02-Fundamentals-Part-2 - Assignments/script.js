// ****** Assignment - 1 => LECTURE: Functions ****** //
// 1. Write a function called 'describeCountry' which takes three parameters:
// 'country', 'population' and 'capitalCity'. Based on this input, the
// function returns a string with this format: 'Finland has 6 million people and its
// capital city is Helsinki'
// 2. Call this function 3 times, with input data for 3 different countries. Store the
// returned values in 3 different variables, and log them to the console


// ****** Assignment - 2 => LECTURE: Function Declarations vs. Expressions ****** //
// 1. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration
// called 'percentageOfWorld1' which receives a 'population' value, and
// returns the percentage of the world population that the given population
// represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of
// the world population
// 2. To calculate the percentage, divide the given 'population' value by 7900
// and then multiply by 100
// 3. Call 'percentageOfWorld1' for 3 populations of countries of your choice,
// store the results into variables, and log them to the console
// 4. Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called
// 'percentageOfWorld2', and also call it with 3 country populations (can be
// the same populations)


// ****** Assignment - 3 => LECTURE: Arrow Functions ****** //
// 1. Recreate the last assignment, but this time create an arrow function called
// 'percentageOfWorld3'


// ****** Assignment - 4 => LECTURE: Functions Calling Other Functions ****** //
// 1. Create a function called 'describePopulation'. Use the function type you
// like the most. This function takes in two arguments: 'country' and
// 'population', and returns a string like this: 'China has 1441 million people,
// which is about 18.2% of the world.'
// 2. To calculate the percentage, 'describePopulation' call the
// 'percentageOfWorld1' you created earlier
// 3. Call 'describePopulation' with data for 3 countries of your choice


// ****** Assignment - 5 => LECTURE: Introduction to Arrays ****** //
// 1. Create an array containing 4 population values of 4 countries of your choice.
// You may use the values you have been using previously. Store this array into a
// variable called 'populations'
// 2. Log to the console whether the array has 4 elements or not (true or false)
// 3. Create an array called 'percentages' containing the percentages of the
// world population for these 4 population values. Use the function
// 'percentageOfWorld1' that you created earlier to compute the 4
// percentage values


// ****** Assignment - 5 => LECTURE: Basic Array Operations (Methods) ****** //
// 1. Create an array containing all the neighbouring countries of a country of your
// choice. Choose a country which has at least 2 or 3 neighbours. Store the array
// into a variable called 'neighbours'
// 2. At some point, a new country called 'Utopia' is created in the neighbourhood of
// your selected country. So add it to the end of the 'neighbours' array
// 3. Unfortunately, after some time, the new country is dissolved. So remove it from
// the end of the array
// 4. If the 'neighbours' array does not include the country â€˜Germanyâ€™, log to the
// console: 'Probably not a central European country :D'
// 5. Change the name of one of your neighbouring countries. To do that, find the
// index of the country in the 'neighbours' array, and then use that index to
// change the array at that index position. For example, you can search for
// 'Sweden' in the array, and then replace it with 'Republic of Sweden'.


// ****** Assignment - 6 => LECTURE: Introduction to Objects ****** //
// 1. Create an object called 'myCountry' for a country of your choice, containing
// properties 'country', 'capital', 'language', 'population' and
// 'neighbours' (an array like we used in previous assignments)


// ****** Assignment - 7 => LECTURE: Dot vs. Bracket Notation ****** //
// 1. Using the object from the previous assignment, log a string like this to the
// console: 'Finland has 6 million finnish-speaking people, 3 neighbouring countries
// and a capital called Helsinki.'
// 2. Increase the country's population by two million using dot notation, and then
// decrease it by two million using brackets notation.


// ****** Assignment - 8 => LECTURE: Object Methods ****** //
// 1. Add a method called 'describe' to the 'myCountry' object. This method
// will log a string to the console, similar to the string logged in the previous
// assignment, but this time using the 'this' keyword.
// 2. Call the 'describe' method
// 3. Add a method called 'checkIsland' to the 'myCountry' object. This
// method will set a new property on the object, called 'isIsland'.
// 'isIsland' will be true if there are no neighbouring countries, and false if
// there are. Use the ternary operator to set the property.


// ****** Assignment - 9 => LECTURE: Iteration: The for Loop ****** //
// 1. There are elections in your country! In a small town, there are only 50 voters.
// Use a for loop to simulate the 50 people voting, by logging a string like this to
// the console (for numbers 1 to 50): 'Voter number 1 is currently voting'


// ****** Assignment - 10 => LECTURE: Looping Arrays, Breaking and Continuing ****** //
// 1. Let's bring back the 'populations' array from a previous assignment
// 2. Use a for loop to compute an array called 'percentages2' containing the
// percentages of the world population for the 4 population values. Use the
// function 'percentageOfWorld1' that you created earlier
// 3. Confirm that 'percentages2' contains exactly the same values as the
// 'percentages' array that we created manually in the previous assignment,
// and reflect on how much better this solution is


// ****** Assignment - 11 => LECTURE: Looping Backwards and Loops in Loops ****** //
// 1. Store this array of arrays into a variable called 'listOfNeighbours'
// [['Canada', 'Mexico'], ['Spain'], ['Norway', 'Sweden',
// 'Russia']];
// 2. Log only the neighbouring countries to the console, one by one, not the entire
// arrays. Log a string like 'Neighbour: Canada' for each country
// 3. You will need a loop inside a loop for this. This is actually a bit tricky, so don't
// worry if it's too difficult for you! But you can still try to figure this out anyway ðŸ˜‰


// ****** Assignment - 12 => LECTURE: The while Loop ****** //
// 1. Recreate the challenge from the lecture 'Looping Arrays, Breaking and Continuing',
// but this time using a while loop (call the array 'percentages3')
// 2. Reflect on what solution you like better for this task: the for loop or the while
// loop?
